If you are new to coding, you should read this first
[Thinkful - Why learning to code is so damn hard](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)

If you are completely new to iOS Development I suggests you participate in Angela Yu or Ray Wenderlich course on iOS and Swift Development.

Apple-related documents:
- [Apple glossary for terms in ios development](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/GlossaryDefinitions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH12-SW1)
- [Apple official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation)

Oh, and please also read this article from [HackingWithSwift
on How to read Apple's Documentation](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/167/how-to-read-apples-developer-documentation),
it's quite useful as it help you grasp some understanding about what Apple is saying in their documentation.

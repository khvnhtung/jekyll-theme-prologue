If you are struggle when learning to code, maybe this article may be helpful to you.
[Thinkful - Why learning to code is so damn hard](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)

If you are completely new to iOS Development I suggests you participate in Angela Yu or Ray Wenderlich course on iOS and Swift Development.

The complete iOS developer roadmap and guides:
- [iOS Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/BohdanOrlov/iOS-Developer-Roadmap)
- [A high school guide to iOS Development](https://github.com/kjaisingh/high-school-guide-to-ios-development)

Learning about Swift syntaxes:
- [Docs - Swift book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)
- [Tutorialspoint - Swift syntax](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/swift_basic_syntax.htm)

Sites to practice your skills:
- [Exercism - Swift](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/swift)
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)
- [Swift cheatsheet by reinder42](https://github.com/reinder42/SwiftCheatsheet/blob/master/swift-cheatsheet.md)

Some projects to help you warm up:
- [Apple - Getting started project](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/ImplementingACustomControl.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH19-SW1)

Swift terms & documentation:
- [Apple official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation)
If you barely understood the documentation, maybe read this first

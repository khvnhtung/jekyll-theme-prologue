After completing a few remaining modules in Ray Wenderlich and have a basic understanding about Webkit and Autolayout and how to use the Apple Documentation. The final result is the Bull's Eye app which is fully functional! I have been following along the free course of Ray Wenderlich (at least for the first module) and working on building it. I have sideloaded the app to my iPhone and save it as an achievement so I can later look back to it and see how hard I've been through and not giving up  in order to make it.

What I have accomplished so far at the moment:
- Built a fully functionall app called Bull's Eye
- Use Webview from Webkit to display a website in the About section of the app
- Rules in autolayout are called constraints
&nbsp; + Ex: You want a button in an app to always display on the top of the screen -> It's a rule.
- Update frames can be used to move an object back to where it should be (if you already have a constraint for it)
- Grasp a basic understanding of AutoLayout and WebKit.

Sometimes I will look back at these entries and fix some grammar mistakes if needed since I'm still not good at it. For the mean time, bye!

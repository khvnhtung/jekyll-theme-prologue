## Introduction:
It took me the whole morning just to bring the blog up and running thanks to the help of Jekyll. I have pick this theme because it looks easy on the eye and how minimal it is.
One of the reasons why I started doing this its because of -> First, it can act as a note for me so that I don't have to rewatch tutorial videos or rereading something I have already read as it is very time consuming. Second, I got inspired after reading these reddit posts here

[iOSProgramming - Learning how to learn as an ios developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/a19dyg/learning_how_to_learn_as_an_ios_developer/)

and here

[learnprogramming - wiki - how to improve](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_to_improve)

The first one recommends taking up blogging and teaching other about coding, by doing this, it requires you to organize your thoughts and put it together to make information more digestable to the readers. It can also help you to cement your learnings as you have to recall everything you have learnt throughout the day to do this.

The second one is a wiki from learnprogramming that can be a great resource for newcomers to programming. It suggests changing from passive learning to active learning which is what I'm doing right now.

Finally, since I'm still learning English and need to improve my writing skills so sorry for the inconvenience if someone might actually read my diary entries and see that it contains tons of grammatical errors and mistakes. 

In every entries there will be four sections divided like this to list all of my mistakes and feats that I have during the day.

## What I have accomplished so far today:
- managed to get the blog working normally
- learnt about how ViewController in Xcode works from Ray Wenderlich's course:
+ View controller job's to manage a single screen in your app and sometime a portion of it.

## What I need to learn more about:
- I still cannot understand Object Oriented Programming in Swift
- What's Scope by the way?!

## What I shouldn't have done:
- Skipping parts of video or not rewatching it if I might find something hard to understand, it is the same mistake that I have made last summer and as a consequences I'm still here learning all the fundamentals from the beginning. Like for example, Ray Wenderlich was talking about scope in swift but I doesn't know what's scope and how does it works so I decided to skip that part and moved on.

## Some tips and tricks I have learnt today:
- You can restrict device's orientation by navigating to Project > General and scroll down to Deployment Info and tick the type of orientation that you want
- If you want to make an app, create a todo list first so you won't be discouraged after working on it and finds out how much work that needs to be done.
- You'd better read this article if you are new to programming you will know what to expect and to prepare for all the coming dangers.

**Sometimes I will look back at these entries and fix some grammar mistakes if needed. For the mean time, bye!**

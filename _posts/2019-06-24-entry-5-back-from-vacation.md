Introduction:
I'm finally going back to writing blog after a short vacation in Hanoi and have just got a new laptop. 
Learn a lot of things today thanks to the Pomodoro technique that helps splitting time to make learning to code more easier for me.

What I have accomplished so far at the moment:
- A variable/constant which is defined outside a method (in Swift) is called an instance variable/constant <br>
&nbsp; + It is common practice to put an instance variable/constant at the top of the file <br>
&nbsp; + Xcode make instance variable/constant green when its being used inside a method <br>
&nbsp; + Use instance variable/constant if you want them to be around and local variable/constant for temporary usages <br>
- If you declare a local variable that shares the same name with an instance variable. The compiler will think that they all have the same name, which leads to an error.
- Alert in iOS works differently from other smartphone OSes <br>
&nbsp; + After the alert displayed a popup. The program will execute the next line immediately.
- A view controller have two parts <br>
&nbsp; + A storyboard <br>
&nbsp; + A viewcontroller file <br>

What I need to learn more about:
- What's a view controller?
- OOP
- What's nil?
- What's .self?

Some Tips and Tricks I have learnt today:
- Nothing yet today.


Sometimes I will look back at these entries and fix some grammar mistakes if needed since I'm still not good at it. For the mean time, bye!

Introduction:

Finally, a third post. I didn't post anything during Saturday or Sunday, partly because I'm extremely worried about the result of my final term exams that I just don't want to do anything but it was kinda a relief to realized that I have passed it with flying colours (I guess) and partly because I was too lazy.

So far, I have come across a lots of learning materials for developing iOS. I think I will compile all of them and put it on one of my website's page for future reference or anyone else who want to take up iOS development especially for beginners.

Second, while I was bored I found a game called Oxenfree and the story looks good and the soundtrack is awesome. I have played the demo and it looks great. Maybe if you have a chance then you should give it a try.

What I have accomplished so far at the moment:
- Learnt that the term instantiate means creating an instance of an object in OOP
- Added a visitor counter.
- Applying the Pomodoro technique which is to split every studying session into 30 minutes (25 mins to study, 5mins to relax)
- String interpolation in swift means you can use this ```swift\()``` to include a variable or a constant in a piece of strings
For example: ```swift var greetings = "Hello \(name), have a nice day!" ```

What I need to learn more about:
- Scopes
- Optionals
- OOP (STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND)

What I shouldn't have done:
- I still have that instinct to skip over parts that I feel hard to understand.

Some Tips and Tricks I have learnt today:
- You can take notes better by applying the Cornell note taking method. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.goodnotes.com/study-with-ease-the-best-way-to-take-notes-2749a3e8297b)

Sometimes I will look back at these entries and fix some grammar mistakes if needed since I'm still not good at it. For the mean time, bye!
